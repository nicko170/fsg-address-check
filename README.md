# FSG NBN Address Checker

Create a shortcode to display the address checker form.

## Shortcode

`[fsg_address_checker]`

## Installation

1. Download the plugin from the Releases page.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/fsg-address-check` directory, or install the plugin through the
   WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Configure the plugin through the 'Settings' menu in WordPress.
5. Add the shortcode `[fsg_address_checker]` to a page or post.
6. You probably will then want to head back to the 'Settings' page, and click "Import Products" to get the list of
   products from the FSG API.
7. You can then edit the products from the "NBN Plans" page in the WordPress admin. The Content field is used to display
   the product description on the address checker form. Leave the metadata alone, or you'll break the world. Just change
   the content and publish the products you care about.
